**S**teve's **W**orkflow for **E**numerating **E**legant **T**ext listings and disposition**S**

Some sprinkles to make [dmcognigen](https://github.com/simulations-plus/dmcognigen "dmcognigen GitHub") a little sweeter

## Installation

You can install the development version of sweets from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("shum461/sweets")
```

# Functionality

## Create dispositions and listings

- Track counts of flagged or deleted records in a table using the`sweet_disposition()` function.
- Deletion listings are tables of records removed for each deletion flag. Sweets builds off of the [reporter package](https://reporter.r-sassy.org/index.html) to include a workflow of initializing a listing report `build_report()`, populating the report `add_listing_to_report()` and writing the listings `write_listings_report()`                              

- See full details in the [dispositions-and-listings vignette](https://shum461.github.io/sweets/articles/dispositions-and-listings.html).
